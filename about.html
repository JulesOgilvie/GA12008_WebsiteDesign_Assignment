          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Born and raised amidst the stunning landscapes of Scotland, I've always embraced change and diversity, having moved around quite a bit during my childhood. This journey introduced me to a mosaic of people and cultures across Scotland, each experience shaping my perspective and fueling my curiosity.<br><br>Today, I call Dundee home, where I thrive in my role as an apprentice service desk analyst, navigating the intricate world of technology with a unique vantage point shaped by my visual impairment.
          </p>
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>My educational path has been as colorful as the art I create. After dedicating three years to studying animation, I was captivated by the magic of bringing ideas to life through visuals.<br><br>This passion for creativity didn&apos;t stop there; I ventured into a one-month Code Clan course in web development, where I earned an HNC qualification. The blend of art and technology excites me, showcasing my belief that creativity knows no boundsâ€”whether through pixels on a screen or lines on paper.</p>
          <h3>Interests</h3>
          <p>In addition to my professional journey, I relish diving into topics that intrigue me during my downtime. Coding, website development, and game design are just a few of the realms I explore, each offering new challenges and opportunities for growth.<br><br>I thrive on hands-on projects and the thrill of creating something from scratch, whether that&apos;s a captivating piece of art or a functional website. <br><br>As I continue to learn and evolve, I&apos;m excited to see where this blend of passion, creativity, and technology will take me next.</p>
