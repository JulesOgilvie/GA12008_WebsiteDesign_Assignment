# Information System Development: Assessment 1
## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a fully functional static portfolio<br>
website using only HTML and CSS. The project will assess students' understanding of:<br>
- HTML structure and semantic elements.<br>

- Practical experience in version control and project deployment using GitHub Pages.<br>

## Project Requirements
General Instructions<br>
- Use HTML5 for structuring the website.<br>
- Use CSS3 for styling and layout.<br>
- No JavaScript or external frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) are allowed.<br>
- The website must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes<br>
(desktop, tablet, and mobile).<br>

## Design Requirements
### HTML Requirements
1. Use semantic tags appropriately, such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt;.<br>
2. Implement lists (&lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt;) for navigation menus where applicable.<br>
3. Use tables for presenting organized data, if needed.<br>
4. Include metadata in the <head> section, such as:<br>
o Page title.<br>
o Character set.<br>
o Viewport settings for responsiveness.<br>

### CSS Requirements
- Apply an external stylesheet (e.g., style.css).<br>
- Use the following CSS properties:<br>
-- Typography: Fonts, colors, and spacing.<br>
-- Box Model: Margins, padding, and borders.<br>
-- Positioning: Static, relative, absolute, or fixed.<br>
-- Flexbox or Grid: For layout and alignment.<br>
-- Media Queries: To ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.<br>

## Additional Design Requirements
- Include a consistent header and footer across all pages.<br>
- Use a visually appealing color scheme and maintain good readability.<br>
- Apply hover effects for buttons, links, and images.<br>
- Optimize images for web use (use placeholders if necessary).<br>

## Submission Guidelines
1. File Submission<br>
- Submit a zipped folder containing the project files.<br>

correctly.<br>

## GitHub Repository

- Push all project files to the repository, maintaining the folder structure outlined above.<br>
- Include a README.md file with the following details:<br>

-- A live link to the hosted website using GitHub Pages.<br>
-- Instructions for viewing the project locally.<br>

## Resources:
- GitHub Pages Documentation<br>
- Publishing via GitHub Pages<br>

file.<br>
