                I am a Service Desk Analyst apprentice, currently working towards a degree in IT Management for Business, with aspirations to transition into software development. My passion for problem-solving and technology drives me to find efficient solutions, whether through troubleshooting IT issues or developing software. I have a strong foundation in programming, with proficiency in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I am currently expanding my expertise in Java and C++.<br><br>Beyond technical skills, my background in animation, illustration, and technical drawing has strengthened my ability to think creatively and approach challenges from different perspectives. I am quick to learn new technologies, comfortable using Office 365 and Adobe products, and adaptable in fast-paced environments. With a history of leadership, volunteering, and diverse work experience, I value communication, remain composed under pressure, and take pride in helping others.
